# maldiZooMSconverter

Utility to convert mzXML files to mzML directly on Google Drive.

* It can discrepancies in the peak counts that can make some programs thrown an error.
* It allows saving the mzML with or withou (or both) experimental metadata. Some old software like mMass or older versions of some packages fail if they encounter accession terms associated with newer instruments that were not included in the ontology schema. This is only a workaround to be able to load the files, but the full version should be still used and published.
